It involves managing the flow of materials, information, and finances from suppliers to manufacturers to distributors to customers. By focusing on efficiency, customer satisfaction, competitive advantage, risk management, and innovation, organizations can optimize their supply chain and deliver high-quality products and services to their customers while mitigating risks and enhancing their competitiveness in the market.
